# Quatum-Hydrodynamics-with-Fisher-Information
I have implemented the numerical simulation of quantum dynamics as proposed by Deckert et al. (2007). Additionally, I am simulating the dynamics of a modified Schr√∂dinger equation based on the method described in 'A Novel Approach to the Quantum Hydrodynamic Equations of Motion by Means of Fisher Information' (2024), authored by myself
