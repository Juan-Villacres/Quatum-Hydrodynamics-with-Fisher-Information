# Quatum-Hydrodynamics-with-Fisher-Information
I have implemented the numerical simulation of quantum dynamics as proposed by Deckert et al. (2007). Additionally, I am simulating the dynamics of a modified Schrödinger equation based on the method described in 'A Novel Approach to the Quantum Hydrodynamic Equations of Motion by Means of Fisher Information' (2024), authored by myself.

1) In the MATLAB script 'QuantumDinamics_Deckert.m' I have implemented the numerial simulation of quantum dynamics posed by Deckert, Dürr, and Pickl in their paper 'Quantum Dynamics with Bohmian Trajectories'.
2) On the other hand, I rely on the aforementioned script to simulate the dynamics that result from applying the method described in Villacrés (2024). Namely, I use the method to go from a classical equation to its quantum version for the case in which constant Fisher information is applied only to the temporal variable.
